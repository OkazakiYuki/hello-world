# hello-world
the first repository

I'm a beginner of programing. but, I want to develop my skill and i want to work as an engineer.

I'm interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.

I'm in master degree and majoring statistical physics. I plan to do a research that apply statistical physics to finance, so I'm studying finance, either.
